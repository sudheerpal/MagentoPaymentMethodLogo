This patch will help you adding a logo for payment method (paytm in our case) while checkout.

Location for file - methods.phtml is app/design/frontend/DefaultPackage/DefaultTheme/checkout/onepage/payment

Basically we are checking that if there exist any paytm payment method then display this logo for it.

You can put your URL for logo at line #59 in file methods.phtml
